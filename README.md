A turn-based tactical fantasy game

1 Game A Month / Friendly game-jam, May 2016.

The player controls multiple fantasy heros, squadrons and mythical beasts who fight monsters, controlled by AI.

The objective is to destroy all monsters on the level.

Very much a work in progress; criticism now, and contributions post-May 2016 are welcome.
